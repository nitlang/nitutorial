# Visit of the Fangorn Forest

One of the point of `nitcc` is to generate the classes of the AST and visit methods.
You can look around in the generated files.

Let's focus on the Logolas format.

There is an abstract cursor (Atùin in Elfish) that start at (0,0) and that is oriented to the right (because elves like to be right).

There is 3 basic types of commands:

* forward (`⭡`) is used to advance in the current direction, the distance is given by the following number (from 1 to 12).
  Because elves like purity, the final position must be rounded to the nearest integer for x and y. It means that between commands, the turtle is always at an integer position.
* turn left (`⮢`) and right (`⮣`) change the current direction.
  The angle is given from 1 to 12 like in a clock (3 means a right angle). 
* sequence enclosed between `𝄆` and `𝄇` are repeated a given number of times indicated after the closing `𝄇`.
  Note that `Ⅴ` repetitions means that the sequence must be executed 6 times.

## Mission

Using the classes generated by nitcc, implement a program that computes the final position of the Atùin. The logolas file is given as the first argument of the program.

To help you, three logolas files are proposed:

* an elegant and abstract L letter [maenas.logolas](maenas.logolas). Expected result is `(0,3)`
* a glowing and inspiring star [elen.logolas](elen.logolas). Expected result is `(10, -3)`
* a peaceful and warm house [bar.logolas](bar.logolas). Expected result is `(4, 0)`
